How to setup LEMP with docker

Create a project folder, it will contain the source code and nginx configuration.

Seperate the both from each other by creating directories for both.
Currently our project folder will look like this:
	project-folder
 		- nginx
 		- src


In the next step, create a default.conf file in nginx directory.
Similarly clone a laravel project in the src folder. The src directory will hold your source code.

In the root directory create a docker-compose.yml file, this is the file in which we will write the necessary instuctions to create the containers.

In the next step, I will create an text file in the root directory. Please note the name of this file:'Dockerfile'. Dockerfile contains instructions to build an container. 



Now our project directory will look like this:
	project-folder
		- nginx
		- src
		docker-compose.yml
		Dockerfile
