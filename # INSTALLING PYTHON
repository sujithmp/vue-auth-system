# INSTALLING PYTHON

------------------------

1) Checking python is already installed
   python --version 
NOTE* :At the time of creating this note, python 2 version 2.7+ or 3 version 3.4+ or later is required.
   a) To check python 3 is already installed
   python3 --version
2) If python 2 version 2.7+ or 3 version 3.4+ or later is not installed, install python with your distributions package manager.

Here my linux distribution is debain so I can use the following command

   	sudo apt-get install python3
   			OR 
   	sudo apt-get install python
3) Verify that python is installed
	python3 --version
The above command will return the installed version of python3	

# INSTALLATION OF pip

1) Download the installation script using the curl command
   curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
In the above command we uses the  -O (Upper case O) parameter to specify that the file downloaded to be stored in the current folder using the same name it has on the remote host.
2) Run the script using python to download and install latest version of pip and other required support packages
	python get-pip.py --user
			OR
	python3 get-pip.py --user

Note*: While running the above command if you encounter no modules found for distutils.util, please run the below command before running the above command. The --user switch argument specifies pip to install to the bath ~/.local/bin
	sudo apt-get install python3-distutils

3) Add pip to the PATH variable
To do this you have to add the below command to the shell's profile script in your user folder.
   export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
Find your shell's profile script in your user folder.
	ls -a ~

Not sure about  which shell you have, run echo $SHELL

Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login

Zsh – .zshrc

Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login
Here I have bash shell, so I gonna add the path export command at the end of .profile script. Since I don't have a .bash_profile by default. Since .bash_profile does not come by default, you can just create it,if you want to add to .bash_profile. But it's fine if you edit the .profile script which is the default profile script. 

4) Reload the profile into your current session to put those changes into effect.

	source ~/.bash_profile
	     OR
	source ~/.profile

5) Now you can test to verify that pip is installed correctly.
	pip3 --version

sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \$(lsb_release -cs) \stable"
echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main” | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
